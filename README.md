### Colour Scheme

As the page is meant to be a personal profile, I based my color scheme on Manchester United's Red, White and Black. With that as my starting point, I initially opted for a linear gradient background but ended up changing it to a background image across all pages. I found the image on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com/photos/a-white-abstract-background-with-hexagonal-shapes-rAH_wlhdURM).

I based my logo on the same colour scheme using a free logo made on [canva](https://canva.com).

I then decided i wanted to change from the black and white idea to a silver gradient for the Nav bar and Footer.

In my CSS file, I declared some custom variables for my colouring scheme that was implemented throughout the site. it was very handy being able to quickly edit the CSS using the variables rather than having to remember the specific colour I wanted or typing out a long gradient syntax.

- I used 3 different types of gradients, mostly using the same colours, just reversing and switching the colours around so you could visibly see a difference if one was used as a backdrop for another.

- I initially intended on using the following colours for my background '#000000', '#ffffff' and 'red'.

- as mentioned above I ended up changing this to an image background and utilised the following gradients for the navbar, footer, 'about me' hero image, projects cards and skills section.

- linear-gradient(to bottom right, black, silver);
- linear-gradient(to top left, black, silver);
- linear-gradient(to top left, white, rgb(80, 78, 78));

- my text colour scheme didn't change from the start, utilising 'red', '#000000' and '#ffffff'.

- to show my understanding, I have used a variety of colour formats for my variables such as hexadecimal and RGBA.

## Typography

I used Google Fonts for the text across the entire site.

- The font used across the site is [Ubuntu](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?preview.text=Mark.dev&query=Ubuntu). The text is simple and very easy to read all around.
